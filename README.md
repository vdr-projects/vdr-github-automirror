# VDR GitHub Automirror

This repository contains scripts which do the following:

- Keep a mirror of the [official VDR source GIT repository](http://git.tvdr.de/?p=vdr.git) updated on https://github.com/vdr-projects/vdr
- Translate the rich amount of documentation, coming with VDR, into "some kind of MarkDown" to host it on https://github.com/vdr-projects/vdr/wiki

All this is set up to automatically run daily at around 01:00 using GitHub Actions.
